It provides a probabilistic framework which means that besides making predictions, it can also quantify the uncertainty of its predictions, which is useful for understanding the impact of each feature on the prediction.\n","  - Performance: Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression can perform quite well on linearly separable data.\n","  - Speed: It's computationally inexpensive, making it fast for both training and prediction, which is beneficial when working with very large datasets.\n","  - Baseline Comparison: Commonly used as a benchmark because of the ease to implement and interpret.\n","\n","- **XGBoost**\n","  - Accuracy: XGBoost is known for its high performance and speed in classification problems, using a gradient boosting framework.\n","  - Flexibility: XGBoost allows users to define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria, adding a layer of sophistication to the modeling.\n","\n","- **Random Forest**\n","  - Versatility: Random Forest performs well on a wide range of data types without the need for extensive data preprocessing like scaling and normalization.\n","  - Robustness: As an ensemble method, it is less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree and often has a very good performance right out of the box.\n","  - Feature Importance: It provides a straightforward indication of feature importance based on how much they contribute to reducing variance, which is helpful for feature selection.\n","\n","- **Decision Trees**\n","  \n","  - Non-Parametric: As a non-parametric method, it makes no assumptions about the underlying distributions of the data, which is useful for practical applications.\n","  - Handling Non-Linear Relationships: It can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target
